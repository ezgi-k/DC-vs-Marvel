This universe are an area of interest that fascinates not only the new generation but also the older generation. However Marvel and DC split fans in two. The comparison of these will probably never end. In this project, I aim to analyze the characters in these two universes, compare them and visualize the results, although it will not put an end to the discussions.\n",
